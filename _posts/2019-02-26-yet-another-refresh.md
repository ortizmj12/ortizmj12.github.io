title: Yet Another Refresh

Somewhere along the way my blog stopped displaying correctly. I think it had something to do with Github updating soemthing on the Pages backend. All my pages would just show the text with no formatting.

Anyway, I came across Barry Clark's [Jekyll Now repo](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). I went ahead and backed up my old blog, forked the Jekyll Now repo, then copied over my posts.

Now to post useful content somewhat regularly...
