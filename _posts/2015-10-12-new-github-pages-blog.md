title: New GitHub Pages Blog
---

Inspired by Scott Roberts' [blog](https://sroberts.github.io), I decided to checkout GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I've had a blog at Wordpress.com for awhile, but I haven't blogged anything in a long time. I've been thinking about blogging more (again) lately and thinking about moving away from Wordpress, but just wasn't sure what to do. The idea of having GitHub host it though gives me the opportunity to finally learn git and GitHub better though!

So here I am. Easy setup, easy management, simple layout, and a technology that aligns with my current learning plans. I'll write a post here soon about the setup, issues I ran into (those that I can remember), etc.
