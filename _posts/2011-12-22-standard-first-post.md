Hello World! Sooo here's my blog. Here I will be blogging things pertaining to IT (I'm currently a system/network admin) and infosec (I'm working on getting into an infosec position). Normally it'll be things I come across during my studying that I find interesting and worth sharing, a lot will have to do with topics I needed to do more research into. There will also be posts about solutions I've found that were either a pain in the ass to gather all the info for so I'm putting it all in one place, or clever fixes (IMO) I've come up with for certain issues I see in my job or study lab at home. Along with sharing, typing it out in a way that I'm trying to explain/teach the reader, it'll help embed the info into my brain better and ensure that I understand it thoroughly as well.

So here we go!
