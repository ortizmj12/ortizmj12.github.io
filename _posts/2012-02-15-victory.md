I've finally picked this high security Brinks padlock I've been working at for a few days now!

I've always suspected that there were security pins in this lock, but never could tell exactly how many...until I watched this [Picking a Brass Brinks Padlock](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riPO1do9dgw) video!

4 security pins??  I never would've guessed four, but knowing that helped a lot.  As well as knowing that the 2nd pin seems to always been the pin stack without the security pin.  So now I gotta re-pin some of my other locks...or get some new ones ;-)
