title: Lockpicking, Waiting for Downloads...

Working at a remote branch, waiting for some downloads to finish, I spent the time lockpicking!  Lockpicking is something I've been interested in for awhile, but just recently started picking more.

I don't have a lot of locks, just things I've collected over the years, and a 15 piece lockpick set I bought from [LockPickShop.com](http://www.lockpickshop.com/) (11 picks, 4 tension tools).  Off camera, I have a bag with the rest of my locks.  All the locks you see there are the ones I've opened while waiting for the download.  I never did get that Brinks open.  One day... haha

I did end up making my first padlock shim though!  I've bought shims before, but wanted to go the DIY route after re-watching a Deviant Ollam video.  I found a can in a recycling bin in the lunch room...

If you want to build your own, here's some instructions Deviant did for i-hacked.com: [Beer Can Padlock Shim](http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/189/48/)
